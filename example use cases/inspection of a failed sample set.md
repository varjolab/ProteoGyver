# Using MS-inspector to study problems in a sample set
For this exercise, we will use two sample sets: One published, good quality runs, and one with simulated data representing some potential problem in a sample set. In this case, detergent contamination.

For the good samples, we can see that the TIC curves are rouhly similar in shape and intensity over time:

And we can see that the AUC of the TIC, as well as max and mean intensities remain rather similar across the entire sample set:
