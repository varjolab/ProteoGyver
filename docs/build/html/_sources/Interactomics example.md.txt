# Example usecases for ProteoGyver using public datasets
This guide documents the end to end QC analysis of a public interactomics dataset.

## Software and data prerequisites
- FragPipe:
- Interactomics dataset: 

## Fragpipe searches
Since the goal is not to demo how to use FragPipe, default workflows will be used, with minimal consideration given to e.g. parameters of different mass spectrometers. As long as the library used is from the same organism, we will identify enough proteins to demo PG. In a real use scenario, parameters in MSFragger in particular should be set according to the MS settings. 

FragPipe was run on linux with
